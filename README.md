# _Analyzing Channel Statistics : 'Most Popular YouTube Channels' for Data Science_

## **Project Description**

The goal of this project was to analyze the channel statistics and trends of the Most Popular YouTube Channels for Data Science through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Tableau Visualizations. 

In this project, channel statistics for Top 10 YouTube Channels dedicated to Data Science were extracted using Youtube API and the respective Channel Ids. The attributes extracted include the number of subscribers, views, likes, comments, duration and video titles. The extracted data was cleaned and pre-processed to prepare it for analysis.

The Youtube Channels considered for the analysis include:

a) 3Blue1Brown

b) Alex The Analyst

c) Corey Schafer

d) Guy In a Cube

e) Ken Jee

f) Krish Naik

g) Luke Barousse

h) Sentdex

i) StatQuest with Josh Starmer

j) Tina Huang


EDA was conducted on the extracted data to gain insights into the channels' performance and trends. Various statistical metrics, such as the distribution of subscribers and views, correlations between engagement metrics, and time trends in the data were explored. Through this analysis, patterns and trends, such as which channels had the highest engagement rates and how viewer engagement varied across channels, were identified.To better communicate the insights uncovered, Tableau dashboards were created that provided interactive visualizations of the data.
