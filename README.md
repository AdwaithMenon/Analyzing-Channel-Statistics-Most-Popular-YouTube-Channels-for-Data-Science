## _Analyzing Channel Statistics of the Most Popular YouTube Channels for Data Science_

### **Project Description**

The goal of this project was to analyze the performance and trends of the top YouTube channels for data science through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Tableau visualization. In this project, channel statistics for 10 YouTube channels dedicated to data science were extracted, including but not limited to, subscribers, views, likes, dislikes, comments, and engagement rates. The extracted data was cleaned and pre-processed to prepare it for analysis.

EDA was conducted on the extracted data to gain insights into the channels' performance and trends. Various statistical metrics, such as the distribution of subscribers and views, correlations between engagement metrics, and time trends in the data were explored. Through this analysis, patterns and trends, such as which channels had the highest engagement rates and how viewer engagement varied across channels, were identified.

To better communicate the insights uncovered, Tableau dashboards were created that provided interactive visualizations of the data. The dashboards included various charts and graphs that displayed the channels' performance metrics in a user-friendly format. Through the dashboards, the trends and patterns identified in the EDA were communicated to stakeholders more effectively.

Overall, valuable insights into the performance and trends of the top YouTube channels for data science were provided by this project. The combination of EDA and Tableau visualization allowed deeper insights into the data to be gained and these insights to be communicated more effectively to stakeholders.
